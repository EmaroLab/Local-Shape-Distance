# Local Shape Distance

This repository containts a Matlab implemntation for computing the Local Shape Distance (LSD) presented in the article (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3242969.3243032). 

Test2D and Test3D contain respectively tests performed on 2D and 3D triangles for rotation, scale and translation invariance.
